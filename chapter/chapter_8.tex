        \section{Desktop Outcome Expected}
        On desktop or laptop devices, the website is expected to offer a clean and well-organized interface with easy navigation between tasks, schedules, focus timers, and progress tracking. Users should be able to comfortably plan their study routines, run focused study sessions, and view productivity summaries on a larger screen without visual clutter.

        As per our expectations in our desktop app we intended to develop good UI with smooth selection of desired objects to be detected which unfortunately proved to be inefficient interms of performance so the extra tabs were removed afterwards.
        Also with some logs and statistics tabs we thought of keeping each and every generated texts and detected objects throughout the program.
