	\section{Agile Method as Software Development Model}
	The development of the Aesthetic Study Website follows the Agile software development methodology. Agile was chosen because the project emphasizes user experience, iterative design, and continuous improvement. Since the website includes multiple interactive features such as scheduling, focus timers, task management, and aesthetic customization, Agile allows these components to be developed and refined incrementally.
The Agile approach enables frequent evaluation of progress, early detection of issues, and flexibility in incorporating feedback. Each iteration focuses on delivering a functional and usable version of the website, which is then enhanced in subsequent iterations.

	\section{Figma for Ideation and Prototyping}
	Figma was used for ideation and prototyping to design wireframes and interactive layouts of the StudyBug website. It helped visualize user flows, refine the interface, and ensure an aesthetic and user-friendly design before development.\\

	The Project was managed in asana in five sessions:
		\subsection{Project Plan}
			Planning for further steps were done in detail in this session. All the tasks to be done, their sub tasks, deadline of the tasks and subtasks were recorded here. Then the task was linked to respective iteration session by the assigned member before doing the task.
		\subsection{Iteration1}
			Everything related to the first iteration of our project were recorded here including meeting minutes and reports.
		\subsection{Iteration2}
			Everything related to the second iteration of our project were recorded here including meeting minutes and reports.
	\section{Overall Phase Followed}
	The overall project has been completed in three main phase which are:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Planning Phase
		\item Development Phase
		\item Integration
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Planning Phase}
	The planning phase involved identifying the problem statement, defining project objectives, and gathering requirements based on student study challenges. During this phase, features were finalized and the overall structure of the StudyBug website was designed using Figma wireframes.\\
	First the project was divided into four parts:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item UI/UX design
		\item Frontend
		\item Backend
		\item Database
	\end{enumerate}
	These parts were then assigned to each project members who then studied about the respective parts in detail.
	\subsection{Development Phase}
	In this phase, the divided parts were well studied and developed. Then each of those developed parts were tested separately.
	\subsection{Integration}
	In this phase, the separately developed parts were integrated to form a system and integration testing was done.\pagebreak
	\section{Task Workflow}
	Each tasks of every session were done and recorded in a procedural manner and the programmes were recorded and stored in gitlab.\\
	The workflow of the tasks follow following steps:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Get task assigned on the basis of agreement.
		\item A shared GitHub repository was created for the StudyBug project.

		\end{figure}\\
		\item Each team member worked on their assigned tasks using separate branches.
        \item Changes were implemented locally and pushed to the GitHub repository.
		\item Completed work was reviewed and merged into the main branch for integration.
