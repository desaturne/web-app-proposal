        \chapter{Conclusion and Future Enhancements}
        The proposed aesthetic study website aims to address common challenges faced by students, such as lack of focus, poor scheduling, and low motivation. By combining productivity tools with a visually appealing interface, the system is expected to create a supportive study environment that encourages consistency and effective time management. The project intends to demonstrate that thoughtful UI/UX design can significantly enhance user engagement in educational tools.\\
        As for future enhancements, after the initial implementation, the following features could be added:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item Expansion of theme options, layouts, and visual customization for better user engagement
                \item Accessibility improvements including screen reader support, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast modes
        \end{itemize}
